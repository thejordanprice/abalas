# simple-static-server

This is a simple static file server with a status window.
Currently the status window isn't exactly useful; but soon.

It does currently however make for a decent static file server.

### Build Instructions

    Will eventually be added once more code has arrived.

### End Goal

    [x] To have made a simple electron window running an http server utilizing a public www folder.
    [x] I would like to have statistics of requests via ajax inside the small window to show activity.
    [x] Like the simple version of apache that is zero-config.
